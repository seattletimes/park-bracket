Typically the families and kids gravitate toward the patch of sand near the steps and the lifeguard’s outpost at the far right end. Otherwise it is a very young and varied crowd — a runoff of Capitol Hill’s inked, longhair residents, mingling with yuppies from the nearby tony neighborhood and gay couples. The grassy knoll faces east so you’ll have to time it wisely to catch rays in the later afternoon.",
