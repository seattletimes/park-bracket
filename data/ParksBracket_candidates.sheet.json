This year, Round the Rock raised nearly $32,000 for Athletes for Cancer. Race organizer Jeff Underwood said the race has grown every year as the popularity of stand-up paddle boarding has grown. \"It's the accessibility,\" he says. Being lighter, smaller and easier to carry than other water sports gear attracts people to the sport, as well as the vibe. \"Everybody wants to think they're a surfer. Stand-up paddle boarding allows the frat boys in the midwest to think they're surfers,\" he joked."
